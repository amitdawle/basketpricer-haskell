# A simple basket pricer in Haskell

This is a haskell port of the basket pricer problem. A java implementation is available [here](https://github.com/amitdawle/basketpricer)

## Instructions

- You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and bananas.

  - Apples cost 60p and bananas cost 30p.

- Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost

   - For example: [ Apple, Apple, Banana, Apple] => Â£2.10


### Simple offers

- The shop decides to introduce two new offers

  - Buy one, get one free on Apples

  - 3 for the price of 2 on Bananas
